Equipment upgrade is available for rare items as well as normal weapons, armor, and accessories. You can only upgrade enchanted items, and you need the necessary materials.<br1>
Keep in mind that for all upgrades (excluding rare upgrades), weapons must be enchanted at least to <font color="00FFFF">+12</font>, armor to <font color="00FFFF">+10</font>, and accessories to <font color="00FFFF">+8</font>.<br>
Also remember that each upgrade type has a certain chance to fail and that you cannot upgrade weapons with Augment or Rune effects.<br>
Remember that for gloves, boots, and helmets of B-grade and above, upgrades are only possible when the armor is sealed.<br>
Lastly, the items you obtain through the special armor upgrade are always sealed.<br>
